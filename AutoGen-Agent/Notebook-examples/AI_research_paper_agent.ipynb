Query arXiv for papers matching the LLM application search query within the specified time frame.\\n  2. Parse the results to extract relevant information (title, authors, abstract, link).\\n  3. Organize the extracted information into a markdown table format, categorizing papers by different domains (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, robotics).\\n- Example code structure:\\n  ```python\\n  import arxiv\\n\\n  # Define search query and publication date range\\n  search_query = \"LLM applications\"\\n  start_date = \"2024-12-01\"  # Example start date, adjust according to current date\\n  end_date = \"2024-12-08\"  # Example end date, adjust according to current date\\n\\n  # Search for papers\\n  papers = arxiv.search(query=search_query, start=start_date, end=end_date)\\n\\n  # Initialize markdown table\\n  markdown_table = \"| Domain | Title | Authors | Link |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n\"\\n\\n  # Loop through papers and populate markdown table\\n  for paper in papers:\\n      # Extract domain from paper title or abstract (simplified example)\\n      domain = \"NLP\" if \"language\" in paper[\"title\"] else \"Unknown\"\\n      title = paper[\"title\"]\\n      authors = \", \".join(paper[\"authors\"])\\n      link = paper[\"link\"]\\n\\n      # Append row to markdown table\\n      markdown_table += f\"| {domain} | {title} | {authors} | {link} |\\\\n\"\\n\\n  # Save markdown table to file\\n  with open(\"llm_papers.md\", \"w\") as file:\\n      file.write(markdown_table)\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Executor Task - Run the Code\\n- **Executor\\'s Task**: Run the Python script written by the engineer.\\n- Ensure the environment has the necessary libraries installed (`arxiv`).\\n- Execute the script, and it will generate a markdown file named `llm_papers.md` containing the table of papers.\\n\\n### Step 4: Review and Refine\\n- Review the generated markdown table for accuracy and completeness.\\n- Refine the search query or script as necessary to improve the relevance and coverage of the results.\\n\\n### Step 5: Admin Approval\\n- Submit the final markdown table and the script used to generate it for admin approval.\\n- Ensure that the table meets the requirements (5 papers, categorized by domain, etc.) and that the script is well-documented and functional.\\n\\nThis plan outlines a clear division of tasks between the planner, engineer, executor, and admin, ensuring a structured approach to finding and organizing recent LLM application papers from arXiv.', 'name': 'Planner', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '```python\\nimport arxiv\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\n# Define search query and publication date range\\nsearch_query = \"LLM applications\"\\nend_date = datetime.now()\\nstart_date = end_date -
